# Food-Ordering-System-in-LabView
This project is a virtual food ordering system designed for restaurants, cafeterias, or food delivery services. It is supposed to enable menu selection, quantity specification, and a live update of the total cost.

Objective Target Group
- Restaurant managers: Since it reduces manual errors and fastens the process of order taking,.
- Operators of school cafeterias -To streamline a bulk food order.
- Students and Developers: To learn how to make graphical applications user-friendly using LabVIEW.
- Small Businesses: In order to develop a low-cost food ordering application that does not require complex systems.

## General info
The Food Ordering System in LabVIEW is made to simplify the steps in ordering food: an easy-to-use interface allows customers to select food items, their quantities, and check the total cost. It creates a receipt with all order details for confirmation or record keeping.

This would be suitable for small restaurants, cafeterias, and teaching purposes where application development for LabVIEW is demonstrated.	
## Technologies
The project is built with the following technologies and tools:

- LabVIEW: For designing the user interface and implementing the logic.
- NI Toolkits: For handling data visualization and user interaction.
	
## Features
- Quantity Selector: Allows users to input the desired quantity.
- Dynamic Total Cost Calculation: Updates the total as items are added to the cart.
- Order Summary: Displays selected items, quantities, and prices.

## Setup
To execute the project, follow these steps below.

1.Install LabVIEW on your system using version 2020 or later.

2.Download the project files and open the .vi file in LabVIEW.

Configuration:

1.Add a food menu dataset-Consider, for example, text file or LabVIEW array.

2.Verify all paths and indicators to be properly connected.
Run Main VI to launch the application.

## Acknowlegements

- National Instruments (NI) for providing the LabVIEW platform.
- Community resources and tutorials for inspiration and guidance.
